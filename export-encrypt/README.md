## encrypt.ebs

This ElkarBackup post-script will keep an encrypted copy of a custom client/job backup files. It can be useful to upload it to a non-secure cloud storage (Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, etc).

[EncFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EncFS) will be used to encrypt files.

Data will be duplicated (encrypted) in the destination directory. Be sure you have enough free disk space.

Create your encrypted virtual filesystem in your preferred destination:

```bash
mkdir /var/lib/elkarbackup/Dropbox/elkarbackup
encfs /var/lib/elkarbackup/Dropbox/elkarbackup /mnt
#- select "standard" mode (ENTER)
#- type a password for your encrypted volume

```

Edit the `encrypt.ebs` script preferences:

```bash
# Destination directory (EncFS volume)

```

Upload the script to the ElkarBackup web interface and enable it under a client or a job.
